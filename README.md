**AI Agent Guide to S&P 500 Tech Career Pages**

A structured database and navigation playbook for autonomous job application agents. Covers ~68 S&P 500 Information Technology companies, their ATS platforms, career page URLs, and step-by-step application guides.

---

## What is this?

A machine-readable database of S&P 500 IT company career pages, designed for AI agents that apply to jobs autonomously. It includes:

- **ATS platform detection** -- know whether a company uses Greenhouse, Workday, Lever, or a custom portal before you visit the page
- **Form-filling playbooks** -- step-by-step JSON instructions for navigating each application flow
- **Navigation guides** -- Markdown guides for each ATS platform with selector patterns, quirks, and workarounds
- **Structured exports** -- ready-to-consume JSON files of Greenhouse slugs, Workday URLs, and a full company table

This repository is the single source of truth that AI job-apply agents (OpenClaw, browser-automation bots, LLM-driven applicants) can reference to understand *how* to apply at any S&P 500 tech company.

## Quick Start for AI Agents

> **Read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) first.** It is the primary document designed for LLM consumption.

```
1. Find the company:  data/companies.json  ->  search by ticker or name
2. Read the playbook:  playbooks/by-ticker/{TICKER}.json
3. Follow the guide:  guides/{ats-platform}.md  +  guides/companies/{TICKER}.md
```

Example -- applying to Datadog (DDOG):

```bash
# 1. Look up the company
jq '.[] | select(.ticker == "DDOG")' data/companies.json
# -> ats_platform: "greenhouse", api_endpoint: "https://boards-api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/datadog/jobs"

# 2. Read the playbook
cat playbooks/by-ticker/DDOG.json

# 3. Follow the ATS guide
cat guides/greenhouse.md
cat guides/companies/DDOG.md
```

## LLM Skill Import and Usage

Use the `sp500-career-apply` skill for end-to-end job application automation (company selection, ATS routing, filters, fields, and apply packet generation).

### Codex skill import

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills/public
cp -R skills/sp500-career-apply ~/.codex/skills/public/
```

In Codex chat, ask to use `sp500-career-apply`.

### Claude Code style usage

Read and follow:

- `skills/sp500-career-apply/SKILL.md`

Run helper scripts:

```bash
# Filter target companies
node skills/sp500-career-apply/scripts/query_companies.mjs --ats workday --limit 20

# Build one-company apply packet
node skills/sp500-career-apply/scripts/build_apply_packet.mjs --ticker MSFT
```

### Canonical dataset for all agents

Primary runtime dataset:

- `data/llm-careers-dataset.json`

Refresh it after crawl updates:

```bash
npm run llm-data
```

## ATS Platform Coverage

| ATS Platform        | Difficulty | Companies | Key Notes |
|---------------------|:----------:|:---------:|-----------|
| **Greenhouse**      | Easy       | 7         | Public JSON API. Most automation-friendly. Invisible reCAPTCHA on submit. |
| **Workday**         | Hard       | 22        | Multi-step wizard (6-7 pages). Account creation required. Use `data-automation-id` selectors. |
| **Taleo**           | Hard       | 1         | Legacy Oracle ATS. Complex multi-page forms. Being phased out. |
| **Custom**          | Varies     | 38        | Proprietary portals (Apple, Microsoft, Google, etc.). Per-company investigation required. |
| **Lever**           | Easy       | 0*        | Simplest ATS. Many S&P 500 companies have migrated away. |
| **Ashby**           | Easy       | 0*        | Growing among startups, not yet common in S&P 500. |
| **SmartRecruiters** | Moderate   | 0*        | Email confirmation field. City autocomplete combobox. |
| **iCIMS**           | Hard       | 0*        | Iframe-heavy, dynamic IDs. |

*Platform guides are included for completeness since target companies outside the S&P 500 IT sector may use them.

## For Humans

### Contributing

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for full guidelines. In short:

- **Report inaccurate data** -- Open an issue if a career URL is broken or an ATS platform has changed
- **Add a new company** -- Add an entry to `data/companies.json` and create a playbook from `playbooks/_template.json`
- **Update a playbook** -- Edit the JSON in `playbooks/by-ticker/{TICKER}.json` and submit a PR

### Running locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Populate initial data from S&P 500 constituents
npm run seed

# Verify all career URLs are reachable (HTTP status checks)
npm run verify

# Full audit cycle: seed -> verify -> detect ATS -> diff -> export
npm run cron

# Validate all playbook JSON files against the schema
npm run validate

# Build ATS index (group companies by platform)
npm run index

# Export data to exports/ directory
npm run export

# Generate a human-readable audit report
npm run report
```

### Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in:

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=        # Optional: for auto-commit in cron mode
USER_AGENT=sp500-careers-bot/1.0
```

## Auto-updates

A GitHub Actions workflow runs on the 1st and 15th of every month at 6:00 AM UTC. It executes the full `npm run cron` pipeline:

1. Re-verifies all career page URLs
2. Detects ATS platform changes
3. Diffs against current S&P 500 constituents
4. Exports updated data
5. Auto-commits any changes

You can also trigger the audit manually from the Actions tab.

A second workflow validates all playbook JSON files on every push or pull request that touches `playbooks/` or `data/`.
